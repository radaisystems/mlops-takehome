# AI-Powered Summarization Challenge

Create a FastAPI service that utilizes a pre-trained Hugging Face NLP model to perform text summarization on user-provided text inputs. The service should expose an API to receive text input and return a summary in a JSON response.

## Requirements

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Set up a Python environment with the necessary dependencies (FastAPI, Hugging Face Transformers, or any other library you find appropriate)

2. **Model Selection**:
    - Choose a pre-trained NLP model from the Hugging Face Model Hub that is suitable for text summarization.

3. **API Endpoint**:
    - Implement an endpoint `/summarize` that:
      - Accepts a JSON input containing the user-provided text and a desired summary length.
      - Returns a JSON response with the summarized text.

    **Example Request**:
    ```json
    {
      "text": "This is a long text input that needs to be summarized. The FastAPI service should be able to handle lengthy inputs and generate a coherent summary based on the user-defined summary length...",
      "summary_length": 50
    }
    ```

    **Example Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "summary": "A brief summary of the lengthy input text, generated by the pre-trained Hugging Face model."
    }
    ```

4. **Containerization**:
    - Containerize the FastAPI service using Docker.
    - Provide a `Dockerfile` and instructions on how to build and run the Docker container.

5. **Documentation**:
    - Include a `README` file with clear instructions on how to set up and run the service.

## Extension (Optional)

For candidates who wish to further demonstrate their technical abilities, implement the following additional functionality:

1. **Compressed Summary Endpoint**:
    - Add a POST endpoint `/compress_summary` that:
      - Accepts the same input as `/summarize`.
      - Returns a compressed version of the summarized text.

2. **Compression Algorithm**:
    - For each group of consecutive repeating characters in the summarized text:
      - If the group's length is 1, append the character to the compressed string.
      - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

    **Example**:
    - **Original Summary**:  
      `This committee meets annually to assess the effectiveness of policies on environmental protection.`
    - **Compressed Summary**:  
      `This com2it2e2 me2ts an2ual2y to as2es2 the ef2ectivenes2 of policies on environmental protection.`
    - **Sample Output**:
    ```json
    {
      "summary": "This com2it2e2 me2ts an2ual2y to as2es2 the ef2ectivenes2 of policies on environmental protection."
    }
    ```
